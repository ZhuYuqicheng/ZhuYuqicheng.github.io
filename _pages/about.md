I'm Yuqicheng Zhu. As a Ph.D. student affiliated with the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) and the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), my academic pursuits are centered around the exciting and emerging domain of Neural-Symbolic AI, which combines traditional rule-based AI (symbolic AI) with modern deep learning (Neural AI). 

My journey to this point has been as unique as it has been enriching. Originating from China, where I delved into the world of art, my academic and professional path took a significant turn when I moved to Germany. I pursued my bachelor degree in Mechatronics at [Otto-von-Guericke University (OVGU)](https://www.ovgu.de/), followed by master program in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/). This pivotal shift from the arts to engineering encapsulates my intrinsic curiosity and passion for learning. Before embarking on my current research path, I gained valuable experience working as an engineer at [Robert Bosch GmbH](https://www.bosch.de/), which provided me with a practical perspective on technology's tangible impact.

Outside of the academic realm, my passions extend into the vibrant world of art. I am not only a researcher but also a freelance painter, cherishing every moment I can dedicate to painting in my spare time. This artistic pursuit has led me to create a range of digital artworks, which I showcase on various online platforms ([Pinterest](https://pin.it/38BVc0S), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/yuqichengzhu)). 

Additionally, I play an active role in the tech community as a [Google Developer Group (GDG) organizer](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-stuttgart/) in Stuttgart. This position allows me to engage with like-minded individuals passionate about Artificial Intelligence and related technologies. I regularly give talks and organize events focused on AI, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment in the Stuttgart area.
